1. How to use the Transition App
    This app works by means of the Transition Activities. These Activities has three major components:
    - content: what's hidden under the face
    - face fragment: the fragment that houses the imageViews for the faces
    - frame: the frame that houses both content and face fragment.

    The App starts off with TransitionStart. When you hold down on the screen, it will create a pop
    up menu that gives you a list of other transition options for you to use. Each option takes you
    to a another Transition Activity that will perform there own function based on what they are called.
    After performing the actions in those Transition Activities, it will take you back to TransitionStart
    to perform another transition.

    Short taps on the screen will cause the robot to blink. Every 5 short taps will cause the robot to
    insist you perform a long click to check out the transition options.
